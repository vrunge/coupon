Description: This package provides coupon collector's problem simulation functions with chosen discrete probability model. Approximate geometric model is also available. Fonctions are designed in order to easily study the primal (expectation of steps to complete the collection) and dual problem (estimations and estimators of the true number of coupons in an incomplete collection).
